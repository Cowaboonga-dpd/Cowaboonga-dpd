- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cowaboonga-dpd
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code neural nets.  Newish to the subject.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to operate with the GitHub repository so I can avoid reinventing the wheel and pull together working modules correctly and learn.
- 💞️ I’m looking to find the signal in the noise and avoid needlessly spending money on overhyped promises that don't deliver.  A code prediction algorithm is what I
- have been longing for.  I want a free one that makes me more efficient at coding.
